can do localhost or the cloud one. 
and add user auth, can add viewing permissions for each pattern for each user.
could do captcha for user authentication.

pattern {
    name
    finished
    currentRow
    rows[]

row {

TODAY:

** i should store a version of patternObject thats before i entered edit mode, 
and a version thats synced with the deletions and reorderings that i made.
> the list of elements should be retrieved at the moment i click save
> so that if i deleted or reordered, that will be reflected. 
> so whatever is reflected in the elements when i click save is whatever is sent to the server.

> so i think i shouldn't save the elements in a list
> for save new row i will turn off save IDKDKKKKK


store all my patterns on mongo db, each user has a list of patterns by id (?)
CRUD for patterns and rows on mongodb
C - done, its just adding name
R - done
U - i think i will only allow edits in indiv view mode
D - done

pattern ROW
C - the behaviour of add rows is weird (because saving will automatically trigger the view form)
R - done
U - edit rows and current row works
D

U: 
- new row
- edit existing rows
- edit pattern current row (finished status calculate in server :)

D: delete row

later:
client side input checking for login/register

upload file and autofill new pattern :)

** i want the pencil to lead to pattern view, edit mode. screaming crying :(

** if you delete a row, all the row numbers that you saved in the various attributes will be wrong. then how girl

in edit mode:
enter in added row means new row or save pattern and exit? (i think it means new row)

to test:
addnewrow in edit mode


ideas:
figure out how to set user view permissions
settings: auto propagate st count, enter to save or to next row, etc blablabla
reorder rows
either drag ONLY or edit row number AND press arrow to up down
