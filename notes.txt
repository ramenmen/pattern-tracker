can do localhost or the cloud one. 
and add user auth, can add viewing permissions for each pattern for each user.
could do captcha for user authentication.

object reference
pattern {
    name
    finished
    currentRow
    rows[]
}

row {
    description
    ending st no.
}

todo:
TODAY: 
client side input checking for login/register

upload file and autofill new pattern :)
--redirect after posting (login redirect also doesnt work!)

** i want the pencil to lead to pattern view, edit mode. screaming crying :(





store all my patterns on mongo db, each user has a list of patterns by id (?)
CRUD for patterns and rows on mongodb
C - done, its just adding name
R - done
U - i think i will only allow edits in indiv view mode
D - done

pattern ROW
C - done (the behaviour of add rows WAS weird (because saving will automatically trigger the view form))
R - done
U - edit rows and current row works
D - done

U: 
- new row
- edit existing rows
- edit pattern current row (finished status calculate in server :)

D: delete row

later:


** if you delete a row, all the row numbers that you saved in the various attributes will be wrong. then how girl

in edit mode:
enter in added row means save pattern and exit

to test:
addnewrow in edit mode


ideas:
figure out how to set user view permissions
settings: auto propagate st count, enter to save or to next row, etc blablabla
reorder rows
either drag ONLY or edit row number AND press arrow to up down
